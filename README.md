##  AI-Powered Weather Forecasting for Major Pakistani Cities  

This project leverages **Random Forest Regression** to enhance weather forecasting accuracy for major Pakistani cities, including **Lahore, Karachi, Islamabad, and Quetta**. Using **historical weather data (Jan 2020 - May 2024) from the Open-Meteo API**, the model captures **seasonal trends and daily variations** to predict **mean temperatures** effectively.  

###  Key Features:  
✅ **Machine Learning-Based Forecasting** – Uses **Random Forest Regression** to predict mean temperatures.  
✅ **Data-Driven Insights** – Integrates **historical and real-time weather data** for improved predictions.  
✅ **Short-Term Forecasting** – Predicts **next-week temperature trends** for practical use.  
✅ **Urban Planning Support** – Provides actionable weather insights for city planners, decision-makers, and residents.  

### Technologies Used:  
- **Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy**  
- **Random Forest Regression Model**  
- **Open-Meteo API for Weather Data**  
- **Feature Engineering for Trend Analysis**  

This project contributes to **more reliable and data-driven weather predictions**, helping cities adapt to climate change and urbanization challenges. 🚀
